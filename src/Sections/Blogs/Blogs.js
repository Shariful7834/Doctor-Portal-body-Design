        <Accordion.Header>Difference Between JavaScript vs Node Js</Accordion.Header>
        <Accordion.Body>
        JavaScript is a simple programming language that runs in any browser JavaScript Engine. 
            Javascript is a lightweight, object-oriented scripting language that is used to build dynamic HTML pages 
            with interactive effects on a webpage. Whereas Node JS is an interpreter or running environment for a JavaScript 
            programming language that holds many excesses, it requires libraries that can easily be accessed from JavaScript 
            programming for better use. We can use Node.js to execute and run the code outside of the browser. Node.js was developed 
            and introduced by Ryan Dahl in 2009. Node.js can be used to create a variety of applications, including web apps, real-time 
            chat apps, command-line apps, and REST API servers, among others.

        <Accordion.Header>Difference Between SQl and NoSQL database</Accordion.Header>
        <Accordion.Body>
        SQL databases are vertically scalable, SQL databases are primarily called Relational Databases (RDBMS). 
            SQL databases are table-based.SQL databases follow ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability) 
            Great support is available for all SQL databases from their vendors. Also, a lot of independent consultants are there who 
            can help you with SQL databases for very large-scale deployments. while NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable. NoSQL databases 
            are primarily called non-relational or distributed databases. A NoSQL database has a dynamic schema for unstructured data. Data is 
            stored in many ways which means it can be document-oriented, column-oriented, graph-based, or organized as a KeyValue store. NoSQL 
            databases are either key-value pairs, document-based, graph databases, or wide-column stores.

        <Accordion.Header>What is the purpose of JWT and how does it work</Accordion.Header>
        <Accordion.Body>
        JWT, or JSON Web Token, is an open standard (RFC 7519) that defines a compact and self-contained way for 
        securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. This information can be verified and 
        trusted because it is digitally signed. In authentication, when the user successfully logs in using their 
        credentials, a JSON Web Token will be returned. Since tokens are credentials, great care must be taken to 
        prevent security issues. In general, you should not keep tokens longer than required. Whenever the user wants 
        to access a protected route or resource, the user agent should send the JWT, typically in the Authorization header 
        using the Bearer schema.

        <Accordion.Header>When should you use node.js and when should you use mongodb?</Accordion.Header>
        <Accordion.Body>
        Nodejs is a Javascript engine that we can write any application we want (by programming in the Javascript language). 
        It runs our Javascript code. Any project needs a programming environment and a runtime library that offers you basic programming 
        tools/support and can compile and/or interpret our code. Nodejs is a tool for the Javascript programming language. There are other 
        similar tools for other languages as well. So, if we want to write some kind of stand-alone program or server in Javascript, then we 
        can use node.js for it. MongoDB is a database engine. Code within some application or server uses MongoDB to save, query, or update data 
        in a database. There are many web servers built with node.js that will then use MongoDB for storing data. If your application needs the ability 
        to persistently store data in a way that you can efficiently query or update it later, then you would typically use some form of a database. There 
        are dozens of popular databases. MongoDB is one such database.
